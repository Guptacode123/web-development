            <p>Since bursting onto the Silicon Valley scene more than two decades ago, the 50-year-old serial entrepreneur has kept the public captivated with his business antics.</p>

            <p>Born in South Africa, Mr Musk showed his talents for entrepreneurship early, going door-to-door with his brother selling homemade chocolate Easter eggs and developing his first computer game at the age of 12.</p>
                
            <p>He has described his childhood as difficult, affected by his parents' divorce, bullying at school and his own difficulty picking up on social cues because of Asperger's Syndrome. At the earliest opportunity, he left home for college, moving to Canada and then the US, where he studied economics and physics at the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League college. </p>

                <p>Elon Musk cofounded six companies, including electric car maker Tesla, rocket producer SpaceX and tunneling startup Boring Company.</p>

                <p>He owns about 23% of Tesla between stock and options, but has pledged more than half his shares as collateral for loans.</p>

                <p>SpaceX, founded in 2002, is worth $127 billion after a funding round in May 2022; it quadrupled its value in three years.</p>

                <p>Boring Company, which aims to defeat traffic, raised $675 million in April 2022 at a $5.7 billion valuation.</p>

                <p>Twitter's board agreed to sell the company to Musk for $44 billion in April 2022, after he disclosed a 9.1% stake and threatened a hostile takeover.</p>

                <p>The deal closed in October 2022 after Musk tried to back out and Twitter sued. Musk now owns an estimated 74% of the company. </p>
